                Lovebirds are among the most social and loving birds on the planet, but that doesn’t mean they’re the easiest birds to care for. They require a bit of work and patience and a ton of consistency, but the payoff is huge.

They’re extremely loving creatures that can bond with a human in a way that few other birds can. But what do you need to do to care for these tiny birds, and what should you expect if you get one? We answer both those questions and more here.
