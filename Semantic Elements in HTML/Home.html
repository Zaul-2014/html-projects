        <p style="color: rgb(255, 81, 0);">Although they are a type of parrot, and they do have the ability to mimic human speech, lovebirds are not among those species that most would consider talking birds. This is because they very rarely decide to speak, and if they do choose to mimic a sound, more often than not they repeat simple noises such as whistles or household sounds such as doorbells and microwaves.

It is not known why some lovebirds are more prone to mimicking speech than others, but it is widely believed that those who do learn to talk are taught from a very young age.</p>
