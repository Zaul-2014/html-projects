    <h1>Bees:
    </h1>
    <p><mark>Bee's</mark> are winged insects that form a monophyletic clade Anthophila within the <sup>superfamily</sup> Apoidea of the order Hymenoptera,[1] with over 20,000 <del>unknown</del> species in seven recognized families.[2][3][4] Some species – including honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees – are social insects living in highly hierarchical colonies, while most species (>90%) – including mason bees, carpenter bees, leafcutter bees, and sweat bees – are solitary. Members of the most well-known bee genus, Apis (i.e. honey bees), are known to construct hexagonally celled waxy nests called hives.

Unlike the closely related wasps and ants, who are carnivorous/omnivorous, bees are herbivores that specifically feed on nectar (nectarivory) and pollen (palynivory), the former primarily as a carbohydrate source for metabolic energy, and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients for their larvae. They are found on every continent except Antarctica, and in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants. The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the Halictidae, or sweat bees, but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies. Bees range in size from tiny stingless bee species, whose workers are less than 2 millimeters (0.08 in) long,[5] to the leafcutter bee Megachile pluto, the largest species of bee, whose females can attain a length of 39 millimeters (1.54 in). Vertebrate predators of bees include primates and birds such as bee-eaters; insect predators include beewolves and <q>dragon flies.</q></p>
