        <h1>Maldives</h1>
        <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
        <p>The Maldives,[e] officially the Republic of Maldives,[f] and historically known as the Maldive Islands, is an
        archipelagic country in South Asia located in the Indian Ocean. The Maldives is southwest of Sri Lanka and India, about
        750 kilometres (470 miles; 400 nautical miles) from the Asian continent's mainland. The Maldives' chain of 26 atolls
        stretches across the equator from Ihavandhippolhu Atoll in the north to Addu Atoll in the south.
        
        The Maldives is the smallest country in Asia. Its land area is only 298 square kilometres (115 sq mi), but this is
        spread over roughly 90,000 square kilometres (35,000 sq mi) of the sea, making it one of the world's most spatially
        dispersed sovereign states. With a population of 515,132 in the 2022 census, it is the second least populous country in
        Asia and the ninth-smallest country by area, but also one of the most densely populated countries. The Maldives has an
        average ground-level elevation of 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) above sea level,[9] and a highest natural point of only 2.4
        metres (7 ft 10 in), making it the world's lowest-lying country. Some sources state the highest point, Mount Villingili,
        as 5.1 metres or 17 feet.[9]
        
        Malé is the capital and the most populated city, traditionally called the "King's Island", where the ancient royal
        dynasties ruled from its central location.[10] The Maldives has been inhabited for over 2,500 years. Documented contact
        with the outside world began around 947 AD when Arab travellers began visiting the islands. In the 12th century, partly
        due to the importance of the Arabs and Persians as traders in the Indian Ocean, Islam reached the Maldivian
        Archipelago.[11] The Maldives was soon consolidated as a sultanate, developing strong commercial and cultural ties with
        Asia and Africa. From the mid-16th century, the region came under the increasing influence of European colonial powers,
        with the Maldives becoming a British protectorate in 1887. Independence from the United Kingdom came in 1965, and a
        presidential republic was established in 1968 with an elected People's Majlis. The ensuing decades have seen political
        instability, efforts at democratic reform,[12] and environmental challenges posed by climate change and rising sea
        levels.[13] The Maldives became a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
        
        The Maldives is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation,
        and the Non-Aligned Movement. The World Bank classifies the Maldives as having an upper-middle income economy.[14] The
        Maldives is a Dialogue Partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.[15] Fishing has historically been the dominant
        economic activity, and remains the largest sector by far, followed by the rapidly growing tourism industry. The Maldives
        rates "high" on the Human Development Index,[16] with per capita income significantly higher than other SAARC
        nations.[17] The Maldives was a member of the Commonwealth of Nations from July 1982 until withdrawing from the
        organisation in October 2016 in protest of allegations of its human rights abuses and failing democracy.[18] The
        Maldives rejoined the Commonwealth on 1 February 2020 after showing evidence of functioning democratic processes and
        popular support.[19]
        
        Etymology
        See also: Names of the Maldives
        According to legends, the first settlers of the Maldives were people known as Dheyvis.[20] The first Kingdom of the
        Maldives was known as Kingdom of Dheeva Maari [bn].[21] During the 3rd century BCE visit of emissaries, it was noted
        that the Maldives was known as Dheeva Mahal.[20]
        
        During c. 1100 – 1166, the Maldives was also referred to as Diva Kudha, and the Laccadive archipelago which was a part
        of the Maldives was then referred to as Diva Kanbar by the scholar and polymath al-Biruni.[22]
        
        The name Maldives may also derive from Sanskrit माला mālā (garland) and द्वीप dvīpa (island),[23] or මාල දිවයින Maala
        Divaina ("Necklace Islands") in Sinhala.[24] The Maldivian people are called Dhivehin. The word Dheeb/Deeb (archaic
        Dhivehi, related to Sanskrit द्वीप, dvīpa) means "island", and Dhives (Dhivehin) means "islanders" (i.e.,
        Maldivians).[25] In Tamil, "Garland of Islands" can be translated as Mālaitīvu (மாலைத்தீவு).[26]
        
        The venerable Sri Lankan chronicle Mahavamsa mentions an island designated as Mahiladiva ("Island of Women", महिलादिभ)
        in Pali, likely arising from an erroneous translation of the Sanskrit term, signifying "garland".
        
        Jan Hogendorn, professor of economics at Colby College, theorised that the name Maldives derives from the Sanskrit
        mālādvīpa (मालाद्वीप), meaning "garland of islands".[23] In Malayalam, "Garland of Islands" can be translated as
        Maladweepu (മാലദ്വീപ്).[27] In Kannada, "Garland of Islands" can be translated as Maaledweepa (ಮಾಲೆದ್ವೀಪ).[28] None of
        these names are mentioned in any literature, however, classical Sanskrit texts dating back to the Vedic period mention
        the "Hundred Thousand Islands" (Lakshadweepa), a generic name which would include not only the Maldives, but also the
        Laccadives, Aminidivi Islands, Minicoy, and the Chagos island groups.[29][30]
        
        Medieval Muslim travellers such as Ibn Battuta called the islands Maḥal Dībīyāt (محل ديبية) from the Arabic word maḥal
        ("palace"), which must be how the Berber traveller interpreted the name of Malé, having been through Muslim North India,
        where Perso-Arabic words were introduced to the local vocabulary.[31] This is the name currently inscribed on the scroll
        in the Maldives state emblem.[1] The classical Persian/Arabic name for the Maldives is Dibajat.[32][33] The Dutch
        referred to the islands as the Maldivische Eilanden (pronounced [mɑlˈdivisə ˈʔɛilɑndə(n)]),[34] while the British
        anglicised the local name for the islands first to the "Maldive Islands" and later to "Maldives".[34]
        
        In a conversational book published in 1563, Garcia de Orta writes: "I must tell you that I have heard it said that the
        natives do not call it Maldiva but Nalediva. In the Malabar language, nale means four, and diva means island. So that in
        that language, the word signifies 'four islands', while we, corrupting the name, call it Maldiva."[35]
        
        The local name for Maldives by the Maldivian people in Dhivehi language is "Dhivehi Raajje", (Dhivehi:
        ދިވެހިރާއްޖެ).[36]</p>    <head>
